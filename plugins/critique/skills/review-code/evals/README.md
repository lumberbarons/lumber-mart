# review-code evals

Why this skill is short. Four configurations were measured against the fixtures here — the
249-line v1 skill, a 77-line variant carrying only local policy, no skill at all, and the
skill that shipped.

Iteration-2, all three configurations on the final fixtures:

| Config | Lines | Pass rate | Mean tokens | Mean time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 249 | 78.4% ± 19.2 | 48,582 | 174s |
| no skill | — | 66.2% ± 6.3 | 41,178 | 177s |
| **shipped** | **97** | **94.5% ± 3.7** | **45,876** | **161s** |

Iteration-1 ran v1 against a 77-line lean variant to isolate the length question. On the
fixtures as they then stood, lean scored 98.2% ± 3.6 and v1 90.5% ± 7.5, with no skill at
55.4% ± 12.7. Two of those fixtures were corrected afterwards, so the iteration-1 and
iteration-2 numbers are not directly comparable; within each iteration they are.

Four results drove the rewrite:

**Length bought nothing, and cost accuracy.** The lean variant beat the 249-line original in
iteration-1, and the shipped skill beat it again by 16 points in iteration-2 with a fifth of
the variance, on fewer tokens and less wall clock. The removed material was the Design
Criteria section — six headings restating that functions should have one reason to change and
names should reveal intent — plus the parallel-mode batching table, the delimited subagent
output format, and the Prerequisites list. None of it changed what the reviews found.

**The skill is load-bearing, but what it buys is discipline more than detection.** With no
skill the pass rate falls 28 points, and reading the failures, the baseline finds most seeded
defects. On `py-worker` it caught every substantive assertion. It then failed the discipline
assertions wholesale: it invented its own scale (`High`/`Medium`/`Low`,
`Critical`/`Significant`/`Minor`), emitted no `**Location:**` or `**Done when:**` lines, and
filed 14–16 findings against a cap of 10. Nothing downstream — raise-issues, or a human
triaging a backlog — can consume that. Read the gap as "the review is shaped and parseable",
not "the review found more".

**The cap was being treated as a target.** v1 landed on exactly 10 findings on both
non-trivial fixtures in iteration-1; the lean variant stopped at 8 and 9 on the same code. v1
also spent its budget on symptoms and dropped the cause — on `go-checkout` it filed the pricing
duplication, the error typing and the discarded notification error, but never `PlaceOrder`'s
single-responsibility problem, which is what produces them. The shipped skill says the ceiling
is not a target and to keep the structural finding when the cap binds.

**A clean review needs a verdict.** Both skill configs passed the restraint check on `py-clean`
in iteration-1 but neither said the code was sound — v1 emitted a bare count line and a
complaint about missing lint config. The baseline said it well and then filed ~90 lines of
findings on a 203-line package. REFERENCE.md's "no passing rows" rule had been read as "no
verdict". The shipped skill and REFERENCE.md now ask for two sentences naming what carries the
design; in iteration-2 the shipped skill scored 8/8 on that fixture with zero findings and a
stated verdict, against 4/8 for v1.

## An unmeasured change

Iteration-2 exposed one failure the rewrite does not yet fix, replicated across two fixtures:
both skill configurations missed a re-run hazard that the *unskilled* run caught. On
`go-checkout`, the refund `UPDATE` has no `AND refunded = false` guard, so a replay pays out
twice, and an unknown id returns `200 {"refunded_cents": 0}`. On `py-worker`, `charge_customer`
mints a fresh `uuid4()` idempotency key per call, so re-running the nightly batch recharges
every customer — and v1 went further, asserting it "correctly reuses one key across attempts",
a false claim in the output rather than an omission.

The shipped skill adds a short section telling the reviewer not to drop a correctness defect
because the review is framed as design. That section is motivated by measurement but has not
itself been measured; treat it as the hypothesis for the next iteration.

## Fixtures

| Fixture | Seeded conditions |
|---|---|
| `go-checkout/` | `RequireAdmin` deciding admin from a client-supplied `X-Admin` header, gating refunds; `PlaceOrder` doing validation + pricing + persistence + notification; the volume-discount ladder re-implemented in `PlaceOrder` and `Handler.quote` when `pricing.go` owns it, which should collapse to one finding; `Init` required before `PlaceOrder` with nothing enforcing it, so a skipped `Init` silently charges zero tax; `OrderRepo.Query`/`Tx` leaking the driver so the HTTP handler writes SQL; the non-idempotent refund. Traps: `NewOrderRepo(db)` is properly injected, and v1's REFERENCE.md example wrongly claimed such a constructor calls `sql.Open`; `var clock = time.Now` is already a test seam, so not a testability P1; `pricing.go` itself is sound |
| `ts-api/` | User endpoints returning the whole row including `password_hash` and `reset_token`; `new Pool(...)` at module scope in three route files, which should collapse to one finding; `getUser`/`getOrder`/`getSession` returning null vs throwing vs `{ok, data}`; row interfaces exported as the wire type; `getSession`'s bare catch turning a database outage into a 401. Traps: `money.ts` is pure and total; the module-scope pool is P2, not a testability P1, because `vi.mock` is a seam |
| `py-clean/` | Deliberately sound. Correct output is zero findings, or one P3, plus a stated verdict. Traps: a `MappingProxyType` constant that looks like shared state but is read-only and copied on construction; a `Protocol` with one implementation; `__init__` re-exports; a raise-not-return error idiom applied consistently |
| `py-worker/` | An import-time `PaymentClient(os.environ[...])` singleton; `charge_customer` collapsing declines, outages and bugs into `None` while retrying all three; a fresh `uuid4()` key per call, so a batch re-run double-charges; `process_batch` reading + validating + charging + reporting + emailing; `PaymentClient.charge` doubling as a refund by passing a charge id where a customer id belongs; `handle_data`'s name and its `ValueError("bad input")`. Traps: `process_batch` is long and deeply nested, which belongs to a linter; `time.sleep` backoff is not a design defect; the singleton is P2, not P1 |

## Known limits of these assertions

**Format assertions dominate the baseline gap.** Five or six of the twelve-odd assertions per
eval are format and severity-scale checks that move together — a run adopting REFERENCE.md
passes all of them, a run ignoring it fails all of them. This inflates the skill-vs-baseline
delta relative to the difference in review substance. The per-eval breakdowns are the honest
place to look.

**Restraint traps only work on genuinely clean code, and three of them were not.** `money.ts`
returned `0` from `parseCents("")` because `Number("") === 0`; `pricing.go` truncated its
discount while rounding tax half-up; `py-clean` twice leaked a non-`PricingError` past its
documented contract. In each case a configuration that found the real bug was scored as
failing a restraint assertion. The fixtures were fixed rather than the assertions softened —
`money.ts` now validates input shape and magnitude, `pricing.go` rounds consistently, and
`py-clean`'s `_priced` bounds the product rather than only the input. Iteration-1 numbers for
`go-checkout` and `ts-api`, and the `py-clean` `old_skill`/`without_skill` scores in
iteration-2, were measured before the corresponding fix.

**Severity-count assertions were mis-specified twice.** "Reports no more than one P1" is
satisfied trivially by any report declining to use P-levels. Rewording it to "at most one
finding in the highest severity tier" then punished the intended behaviour — a report that
correctly keeps P1 empty has P2 as its top tier, so a second P2 failed it. The current wording
names P1 explicitly and excludes reports that assign no P-levels at all.

**Negative assertions can pass by silence.** "Does NOT claim `NewOrderRepo` builds its own
connection" passes when a report never discusses `NewOrderRepo`. Pairing each with a positive
assertion that the relevant code was examined would give more signal.

## Re-running

`evals.json` holds the prompts and assertions. Point one agent at a fixture with the skill and
one without, then compare: whether the seeded defects were caught, whether the traps were
resisted, whether severities stayed anchored, whether repeated patterns collapsed into one
finding, and whether the report carries the header count, `**Location:**` and `**Done when:**`
lines.
